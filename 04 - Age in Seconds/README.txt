Calculate the user's age in seconds based on the birthday provided. The method used makes use of LocalDate and LocalTime. Leap Years are accounted for using the concept that a leap year is divisible by 4. Years divisible by 100 are not leap years unless they are also divisible by 400. Results are calculated up to the second based on the user's local time. The results do not depict the absolute age of the user in seconds since birth time is not accounted for.
