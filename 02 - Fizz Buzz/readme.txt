This challenge was originally an attempt at the Code Eval challenge but due to a misunderstanding is not valid according to the Code Eval requirements. If you are trying
to use the source code as a submission for a contest or challenge don't waste your time.
It might be accepted with some modifications but you are better off submitting your own work.
